# Deprecated SupremeBot
<b> Note: This Bot no longer works after Supreme integrates reCAPTCHA on their sites.</b> 

Provides autonomous buying process for securing limited sneakers and clothings on Supreme.com

## Getting Started
1. Import this repo in Netbean
2. Start the program
3. Press <i> Add </i> for creating one checkout process
   - Item name has to be exactly the same as it is on Supreme
   - Free size only avaiable for accessory 
   - Delay checkout is recommended to be set to 1000ms
4. Once everything is set, begin to checkout by clicking <i>Start</i>

## Limitations
1. The bot doesn't perform well when the website crashes or not responds to the requests.
2. Checking out multiple items at once could dramatically decrease the speed of the program.
